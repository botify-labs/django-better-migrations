Feature: check rules to protect against dangerous actions
=========================================================

This feature allows checking rules to protect against dangerous actions
when the code is about to be released in production.

Example:

```python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
# Generated by Django 1.9 on 2017-12-01 00:00
from __future__ import unicode_literals

from django.db import migrations, models


# Check results:
# Check OK: No ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN with non-NULL constraint
class Migration(migrations.Migration):
    ...

    operations = [
        migrations.CreateModel(
            ...
        ),
    ]
```


Configuration
-------------

You can configure the feature like this in your application main settings via the
`BETTER_MIGRATIONS["RULES"]` list:
```python
from my_migration_rules import ACustomerRule

BETTER_MIGRATIONS = {
    "RULES": [
        ACustomRule,
    ]
}
```

Note that this setting already includes a few rules implemented by the project,
so you may want to modify it instead:
```python
from django_better_migrations.apps import DEFAULT_CONFIGURATION
from my_migration_rules import ACustomerRule


BETTER_MIGRATIONS = {
    "RULES": DEFAULT_CONFIGURATION["RULES"] + [
        ACustomerRule,
    ],
}
